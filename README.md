# LaTeX-dominated configuration for GNU Emacs Version 30

This repository stores the configuration file (init.el).
This configuration works with GNU Emacs Version 30.5, the bleeding edge development version.

I have mapped a bash alias to this profile and Emacs30 so that I can use it parallel with other Emacs profiles.

```bash
e30ld='/Applications/Emacs30.5.0.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --init-directory ~/latex-emacs30 --debug-init'
```

I clone this distribution to the folder latex-emacs30 in my home directory.
Adjust the path to the Emacs binary as required.
This configuration should work on all operating systems with little need for adjustment.
